# Day 1

Here's a checklist for this week's tasks:

## Practice

- [ ] Create a fork of the [workshop repository][workshop-repo].
- [ ] [Install the Rust toolchain][install-rust].
- [ ] Setup your editor for Rust development.
      If you're using Visual Studio Code, simply install the recommended extensions.
      For other editors, make sure the following is working:
  - LSP ([rust-analyzer])
  - debugging support
- [ ] Configure your LSP to use Rust's official linter, clippy.
  - [Instructions for Visual Studio Code][vscode-clippy]
  - [ ] Fix all linter warnings in `hello-clippy`.
- [ ] Setup [rustlings].
      This will download a `rustlings` folder wherever you run the setup command.
      To keep things organized, you can run the setup here inside your fork.
      The `rustlings` directory will be ignored by git, but you'll have everything in one place.
      Note that LSP actually _doesn't_ work for rustlings exercises.
      This is fine, the small exercises are meant for you to grapple with the syntax yourself.
- Solve rustlings exercises (run `rustlings watch` inside `rustlings/`).
  - [ ] intro
  - [ ] variables
  - [ ] if
  - [ ] functions
  - [ ] quiz 1
  - [ ] primitive types
  - [ ] vectors
  - [ ] move semantics (== ownership)

## Homework

The purpose here is to get you comfortable reading documentation and make you aware of some useful things.
Don't get bogged down in the details.
Read until you are satisfied and make a mental note that these things exist.

- [ ] Check out "Rust By Example"
  - [Nesting and labels](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/flow_control/loop/nested.html)
- [ ] standard library documentation
  - [`str::chars`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.str.html#method.chars)
  - [`str::split`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.str.html#method.split)
  - [`str::lines`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.str.html#method.lines)
  - [`str::parse`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.str.html#method.parse)
  - [`fmt`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/fmt/index.html) (module-level documentation of string formatting syntax, used in `println!`)
  - [`env::args`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/env/fn.args.html)
  - [`slice::reverse`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.slice.html#method.reverse)
  - [`slice::sort`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.slice.html#method.sort)
  - [`slice::windows`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.slice.html#method.windows)
  - [`dbg!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/macro.dbg.html)
  - [`include_str!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/macro.include_str.html)
  - [`todo!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/macro.todo.html)

## Optional exercises

If you have time and enthusiasm to spare, you can solve some of these exercises.
You are encouraged to ping your workshop organizer for a code review!
Feedback will focus on adding information, pointing out different ways of doing things and discussing trade-offs. (no nitpicking / perfectionism)
Exercism has a built-in mentoring feature and GitHub PR reviews work well for both platforms.
Choose whatever you prefer.

These exercises were selected because you already learned about everything required to solve them.
However, a performant and or elegant solution might still be out of reach!
So, keep your perfectionism in check for now.
You can always revisit these exercises later to refactor them.

This is not a checklist, but rather an "allow-list"!
Just start with one that appeals to you and do as many as you like.
Exercism focuses on exercises that are designed to push you to use specific language features.
Advent of Code on the other hand is more free-form problem solving.

Make sure you finished the standard library reading, some of those items might come in handy 😉
